#### 1. 📊 Performance Evaluation Profile & Signal Indicators
- **Current Targeted Focus Exam**: **${activeExam || "General Practice"}**
- **Assessment Strength Quotient**: **${acc >= 75 ? "Excellent (Elite Tier)" : acc >= 60 ? "Proficient (Intermediate Tier)" : "Developing Base (Action Needed)"}**
- **Question Response Patterns**: Out of **${total}** MCQs completed, your accuracy rate stands at **${acc}%** with **${correct}** successful resolutions.
- **Practice Consistency Index**: Your recorded active streak is **${stats.streakCount || 0} days**. Daily practice is key to long-term memory retention.

---

#### 2. ⚠️ Critical Vulnerability Hotspots & Topic Risks
- **Primary Weakness Zone**: **${primaryWeakness}** 
  - *Diagnostics*: Your mistake patterns suggest high cognitive friction or memory fading under this theme. Re-read core notebooks and test again with custom lists.
- **Secondary Weakness Zone**: **${secondaryWeakness}**
  - *Diagnostics*: Frequent speed mistakes or minor misreadings have been logged here. Slow down and read explanations carefully.
- **Accuracy Constraints**: You need to increase targeted revisions in **${list.length > 0 ? list[0].subject : 'general subjects'}** to boost confidence.

---

#### 3. 🎯 Recommended Strategic Gameplan
1. **Apply 3-Stage Spaced Repetition**: Re-do the **Mistake Book** items every 48 hours until accuracy on these elements reaches 100%.
2. **Practice Adaptive Difficulty Tuning**: If your overall accuracy is low, filter practice runs to **Easy & Medium** difficulty settings to isolate foundation flaws, then scale up.
3. **Dedicated Subject Drilling**: Choose **${primaryWeakness}** as your daily reading focal point. Dedicate at least 30 minutes to structured note review before jumping into MCQ practice sets.
4. **Consistency Enforcement**: Answer at least 15 MCQs per day to maintain your streak and claim daily achievements.
